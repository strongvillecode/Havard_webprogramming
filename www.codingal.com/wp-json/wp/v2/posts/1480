Scratch programming language is designed primarily for kids with a visually appealing interface.<\/p>\n<p>Kids need to drag blocks from the block palette into the coding workspace to start building programs. Kids can snap code blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. They can modify how their characters look, design their own backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>With Scratch, kids can add their voices and sounds and even photos of themselves and then use the programming blocks to bring their characters to life. This allows kids to create games, animations, and other interactive programs easily.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, children explore coding concepts in a safe and fun environment.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"helps-dev-logical-thinking\"><\/span>Helps develop logical thinking skills<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1494\" src=\"https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Helps-develop-logical-thinking-skills.jpg\" alt=\"Learning scratch programming helps in developing the logical thinking ability\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Helps-develop-logical-thinking-skills.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Helps-develop-logical-thinking-skills-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With Scratch, kids can drag and drop code blocks. It involves dragging and dropping code blocks instead of writing code while children still learn coding logic.<\/p>\n<p>They can see what they are building and the result of their actions right away. This helps kids to understand and analyze the logic behind the programs.<\/p>\n<p>Logic with Scratch builds on foundational concepts such as variables, data types, lists, arrays, loops, and operators. These skills also translate to other languages when students advance from the popular block-based coding to text-based coding.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"stepping-stone-to-high\"><\/span>Stepping stone to high-level programming<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1495\" src=\"https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Stepping-stone-to-high-level-programming.jpg\" alt=\"scratch is basics of learning high-level programming for kids\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Stepping-stone-to-high-level-programming.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Stepping-stone-to-high-level-programming-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Scratch programming is one of the best ways for kids to learn to code.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s the perfect pathway for kids to learn programmatic thinking and get an enthusiastic head start into real-world coding skills.<\/p>\n<p>Many other programming languages require kids to learn text commands and have strict rules about using them.<\/p>\n<p>Scratch enables kids to focus their energy on the fun stuff, thinking of ideas for new programs, working out how to build them, designing them, and sharing them with friends.<\/p>\n<a class=\"blog-ads-mid-banner\" href=\"https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/register\/?utm_source=eu-blog-display-ads\"><img class=\"lazy aligncenter wp-image-1085 size-full\" style=\"filter: drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 2px 4px);\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/blog-mid-ads1.png\" alt=\"Best Online Coding class for kids\" width=\"740\" height=\"276\" \/><\/a>\n<h2><span id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>You have now learned the amazing benefits of learning Scratch programming for kids.<\/p>\n<p>Kids can use Scratch to code their own interactive stories, animations, and games.
