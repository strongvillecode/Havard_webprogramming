Scratch for kids promotes computational thinking, problem-solving skills, self-expression and collaboration.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"what-scratch\"><\/span>What is Scratch?<\/h2>\n<p>Scratch is one of the best ways for kids to learn to code. It involves dragging and dropping code blocks instead of writing code while children still learn coding logic.<\/p>\n<p>Blocks are puzzle-piece shapes that are used to create code in Scratch. There are ten categories of blocks: Motion, Looks, Sound, Event, Control, Sensing, Operators, Variables, List, and My Blocks.<\/p>\n<p>Scratch has four main elements: the stage, the sprites, the script and the programming\/blocks palette.<\/p>\n<p>The stage is where you see your stories, games, and animations come to life. In Scratch, each character is called a sprite.<\/p>\n<p>Script is the set of step wise instructions that you give to the sprite to do a particular task. Programming\/block palette contains all the essential tools which are required to program a sprite to do or say something.<\/p>\n<p>In Scratch, a program is saved as a project. Kids can get started with creating a Scratch projects in three simple and easy steps.<\/p>\n<p>First, you need to sign up on the Scratch website. Next, explore the \u201cideas\u201d section to access the getting started tutorial. Later, create your first project using Scratch.<\/p>\n<p>In this blog, we will explore some interesting<a href=\"https:\/\/www.codingal.com\/blog\/coding-for-kids\/scratch-programming-kids\/\"> Scratch projects for kids<\/a>.
